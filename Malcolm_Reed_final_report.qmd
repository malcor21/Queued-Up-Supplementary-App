## Data source

This final project will utilize the "Queued Up 2024" dataset from the Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory's Energy Markets & Policy department.[^1] The dataset accompanies an
April 2024 report by Rand et al. on the transmission interconnection status
of energy generation and storage projects in the US.

[^1]: "Queued Up: 2024 Edition, Characteristics of Power Plants Seeking Transmission Interconnection As of the End of 2023." From J. Rand, N. Manderlink, W. Gorman, R. Wiser, J. Seel, J. Kemp, S. Jeong, and F. Karhl, 2024. <https://emp.lbl.gov/queues>

The "Queued Up 2024" report synthesizes data from independent system operators (ISOs),
regional transmission organizations (RTOs), and other relevant entities including
utilities. Data cleaning was conducted by the Berkeley Lab team.

Depending on the visualizations included in the final product, this project might
include useful data (e.g., geographic boundaries) from other sources. Those sources
will be cited in the final product if included.

## Basic data description

The "Queued Up 2024" dataset contains 33256 rows, each representing a unique generation
or storage project that has entered the US grid interconnection queue. It is generally
tidy, with one column per variable and one value per cell.

The data 
imports with 29 columns, including 23 character variables, 1 logical, and
5 numerics. However, three of those columns can be removed: `ia_status_raw` is 
vestigial, while `county_2` and `county_3` will not be useful for the purposes of 
this project. I therefore modify the dataset such that it contains 21 character
and 5 numeric variables.

Although there exists notable missingness across parts of the dataset, most instances
are due to conditionality rather than a lack of information. For instance, the `ia_date`,
`wd_date`, and `on_date` variables are mutually exclusive, as they require a project to be
either approved, withdrawn, or operational, and therefore demonstrate high missingness.
Cases like this should not prove an issue for the project's visualizations; approved,
withdrawn, and operational
developments will likely be represented in different figures. The `mw_2`/`mw_3` and
`type_2`/`type_3`, which are used for multifacted projects, indicate missingness
for similar reasons. The majority of variables in the dataset ultimately report 
complete rates at 90 percent or higher, which should be sufficient for visualization
given the size of the file.

## Why this data

Electricity demand has seen an unexpected rise in recent years due to new heavy-hitter
consumers, like manufacturing facilities and data centers. To keep up with load growth
while integrating clean, cheap renewables, US electricity infrastructure must be reformed,
modernized, and expanded. Currently, a wealth of (largely renewable) energy projects are 
seeking approval to eventually enter the grid, a process known as the interconnection
queue. [^2]

The "Queued Up 2024" report provides a comprehensive picture on the type, location,
and status of energy developments moving through the interconnection process. The
attached PowerPoint briefing, which can be found on the project's website, presents
a wide variety of insightful static images. The complexity of the data
suggests that dynamic visualization could prove a worthwhile supplement to the report.
In fact, the "Queued Up 2024" page already includes a useful interactive
portal that hosts a number of highly polished visualizations on queued generative capacity.
However, further visualization exercises could seek to translate other dimensions
of the interconnection queue dataset into a dynamic context.

## Visualization plan

I aim to supplement the "Queued Up 2024" project's existing static
and dynamic data visualizations with additional interactive graphics exploring the
dataset's energy type, queue duration, project status, and location dimensions. The report's
existing interactive data tool provides visualizations of queued capacity
by region and queued capacity over time, both with toggable energy type options. 
The associated interactive maps, also linked on the website, display queued capacity
by state and county. 

This final project will use an R ShinyApp to visualize how queue status, approval
time, and approval rates vary across relevant dimensions. Possible dynamic graphics
hosted on the app include: interconnection requests over time; generative capacity
by energy type over time; approval rate by location, energy type, and generative 
capacity; approval time by location, energy type, and generative capacity; and the 
difference between proposed and actual operation dates by location, time, and generative
capacity. I might also recreate or retool the project's current dynamic visualizations
for the sake of narrative-building within my own final project.
