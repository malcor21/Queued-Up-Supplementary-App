## Introduction

RETOOL
Electricity demand has seen an unexpected rise in recent years due to new heavy-hitter
consumers, like manufacturing facilities and data centers. To keep up with load growth
while integrating clean, cheap renewables, US electricity infrastructure must be reformed,
modernized, and expanded. Currently, a wealth of (largely renewable) energy projects are 
seeking approval to eventually enter the grid, a process known as the interconnection
queue. [^1]

The "Queued Up 2024" report provides a comprehensive picture on the type, location,
and status of energy developments moving through the interconnection process. The
attached PowerPoint briefing, which can be found on the project's website, presents
a wide variety of insightful static images. The complexity of the data
suggests that dynamic visualization could prove a worthwhile supplement to the report.
In fact, the "Queued Up 2024" page already includes a useful interactive
portal that hosts a number of highly polished visualizations on queued generative capacity.
However, further visualization exercises could seek to translate other dimensions
of the interconnection queue dataset into a dynamic context.

## Tab 1: Interconnection Queue by Region

### Subtab 1: Mainland US Map

I first created a map of active projects (or capacity) in the interconnection queue
by US grid region. While a figure like this was included in the original "Queued Up"
report, I thought it would nevertheless be a useful resource to frame the following
figures. 

A comprehensive shapefile of US grid regions was not readily available on the internet,
so I used QGIS to synthesize one. I joined an existing shapefile of ISO regions
created by the US Energy Information Administration with a basic state boundaries
shapefile from the US Census Bureau.[^2] [^3] I then used QGIS tools to create a new layer
including properly labeled non-ISO regions. The resulting shapefile, while not perfect,
was useful to provide a generally accurate picture of the complex US electricity
landscape.

The Mainland US Map visualization displays the number of projects or amount of
capacity (including storage and generation) waiting in each region's interconnection
queue for any time interval covered by the Queued Up dataset.

### Subtab 2: Bar Chart

The second visualization under the Interconnection Queue by Region tab simply
displays the previous information in a more digestible bar chart format. Note that
the same time and outcome type controls are present in above card.

## Conclusions and Future Steps



fulfilling
didn't get to do everything
- could make figures more complex - more options
- different ideas, like a button spitting out a random entry
hindered by randomness throughout dataset - surprising
future studies - join dataset with other elec info for deeper analysis, more informed wrangling
