## Data source

This final project will utilize the "Queued Up 2024" dataset from the Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory's Energy Markets & Policy department.[^1] The dataset accompanies an
April 2024 report by Rand et al. on the transmission interconnection status
of energy generation and storage projects in the US.

## Why this data

Response here.

> Report is interesting, but uses static images where lots
of potential for dynamic viz
> Very nice Tableau interactive viz, but only for some
(mostly total capacity)
> Want to supplement with type-, duration-, and map- based
graphics

> App with multiple tabs
> > Capacity currently in queue by ISO or state
*> > Completion rate by ISO or state (page 3)

*> > IR - IA duration by ISO, type
> > > With option to add average
* > > Examination of active/widthrawn/completed by type
> > Requests over time (sliding year option)
*> > > Capacity and number of requests options, maybe type
> > > bar or line
*> > Requests by type map
