## Prediction problem


This final project will investigate the predictive power of social characteristics
data on voting habits. Specifically, I will construct a
regression problem to examine how county-level demographic information might
be used to forecast Democratic Party presidential voteshare in the 2020 US election.

I am pursuing this final project topic on account of my personal 
interest in elections and social science broadly. It is certainly 
important for campaigns to estimate their support based on
demographic data rather than polling alone; political consultants likely employ
a variety of predictive modeling methods to advise their clients. However, I am
approaching this topic from the standpoint of a hobbyist observer---I hope that 
this project will present an enjoyable opportunity to apply my data science skills
to a subset of social science data with which I am already somewhat familiar.
And while the particular workflows developed during the project are not necessarily applicable
to other elections on account of changing demographics and political trends, I hope
that the lessons I learn here regarding feature engineering with survey data will
prove useful in my future personal and professional endeavors.

## Data source

This final project will utilize the "US Election Dataset" constructed by Kaggle user Essarabi.[^1] The .csv file
includes information on voting habits (raw counts and shares) as well as demographic characteristics,
such as racial makeup, education, income, and occupation, at the county level. According
to Essarabi, data is sourced from the 2020 US Decennial Census, the American Community 
Survey's 2022 5-year estimates, and the "US Election 2020" Kaggle dataset.[^2]

## Data quality check

```{r}
#| label: tbl-data
#| tbl-cap: Overview of US Election Dataset
#| echo: false

tribble(
  ~`Version`, ~`Observations`, ~`Columns`, ~`Numeric variables`, ~`Character variables`,
  "As-imported", 3143, 35, 25, 10, 
  "Tidy", 3143, 28, 27, 1
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

The "US Election Dataset" .csv file imports with 3143 rows and 35 columns. Though it
falls on the lower end of acceptable observation counts, the dataset is naturally
limited by the number of counties in the United States.

25 of the file's
variables, largely demographic statistics, are numeric. Five of those numeric columns
will almost certainly be excluded in future stages of this project: three consist of
raw vote counts, which are redundant, and two provide the vote share for Republican and Other presidential
candidates. The latter columns, being unobservable prior to the 2020 US election, 
do not constitute useful predictors.

The "US Election Dataset" also contains 10 character variables. Two of these are
duplicate county or state identifiers that will be discarded. An additional seven character variables in
the dataset are actually miscoded numeric features that correspond to education 
levels. At least some of those columns will be converted to numeric proportions during preprocessing.

Finally, the dataset has practically no missingness: every column except 
`Median income (dollars)`, which lacks just a single observation, has a 100%
complete rate. "US Election Dataset" is also tidy upon import, with one row
corresponding to a single county-observation, save for the character variable
miscoding mentioned previously.

@tbl-data above provides an overview of the structure of the "US Election Dataset".
Values are provided both for the file as imported and for an anticipated tidied
version that will be developed prior to the modeling process.

## Target variable analysis

```{r}
#| label: tbl-stat
#| tbl-cap: Statistical overview of Democratic presidential vote share, 2020
#| echo: false

tribble(
  ~Mean, ~`SD`, ~`0 pct`, ~`25 pct`, ~`50 pct`, ~`75 pct`, ~`100 pct`,
  33.4, 16.0, 3.09, 21.0, 30.0, 42.6, 95.8
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

@tbl-stat displays summary statistics for `2020 Democrat vote %`, the county-level
vote share for the Democratic presidential candidate in the 2020 US election, as obtained from the 
`skimr` package's `skim_without_charts` function. The mean of the Democratic voteshare variable
slightly exceeds its median, indicating that the prediction problem's target variable
is somewhat right-skewed.

![Distribution of Democratic presidential vote share at the county level, 2020](../figures/vote_patchwork.jpg){#fig-patchwork}

The above @fig-patchwork illustrates that weak right skew: the shape 
of `2020 Democrat vote %` is slightly asymmetric, with a long right tail
from the median of 30% to the maximum of 95.8%. This distribution makes intuitive
sense, as Democrats are generally expected to succeed in a smaller number of high-population
counties. However, it is not apparent that a logarithmic transformation of
`2020 Democrat vote %` is required at the outset of the modeling process given the weakness of the 
right skew and the lack of extreme right tail values. I therefore keep vote share
in untransformed for the time being, although I would be happy
to discuss the usefulness of an outcome variable transformation in the future.

## Misc

I would be interested in incorporating 2024 presidential election data into this
final project if time permits. Since county-level demographics likely experienced
only limited change between the 2020 and 2024 US elections, I might consider adding
a 2024 Democratic presidential voteshare column to the dataset and comparing the 
predictive accuracy of project workflows between the two cases (i.e., exploring if
the most accurate workflow for predicting 2020 voteshare holds up in 2024). Please
let me know if you have any thoughts or tips on this idea!
